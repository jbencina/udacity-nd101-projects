    "I wrote this notebook to illustrate what a single pass of backprop looks like through a simple 3 layer network. I found when I was learning that many examples were illustrated using abstract math notation, conceptual diagrams, and code that didn't seem to match either. I also ran into overly simplified examples which made it difficult to understand when applied to more than a single hidden layer.\n",

The notebook is meant to help you understand how this process works. If you can understand this notebook, you should have no problem converting the concepts to an iterative process. We will build this using only numpy."

If we were using a learning rate we could multiply it here. The learning rate is a scalar number (typically like 0.1) which takes the suggested corrections below, but scales them down. With large networks, we have a very complicated gradients with lots of peaks and valleys as all of our variables interact with each other. Sometimes the suggested correction would jump from one peak to another, missing an optimal (lower) solution in between. The learning rate forces smaller steps (in the right direction).\n",
